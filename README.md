# Code-and-Structures

Welcome to my *Data Structures & Algorithms journey*!  
Here I’ll be solving problems mainly in *C language* (and maybe a few surprises 👀).  
---
## 📚 What's inside?
- Classic problems (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs...)  
- 💡 LeetCode, HackerRank, GFG practice 
- 🎯 My step-by-step coding growth  
---
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- C language (main hero 🦸‍♂)
- Maybe some Python later  
---
## 🏆 Goals
- Practice DSA daily 📅  
- Build strong problem-solving skills 🧠  
- Have fun coding 💻

## ⚡ Quick Note
Yes, there will be bugs. Yes, I’ll fix them. Eventually 😅
